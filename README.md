# Polynomial-Regression


In the field of Machine Learning, Regression is a common term used to define the predictiom values of Continuous Dependant Variable.

Depending upon distribution of data, we can determine whether to use linear regression or non-linear regression.

Linear regression is used when the relationship between dependant and independant is linear.

When it comes to non-linear data, the primary question which comes in our mind is how can we generate a curve which could capture
most part of our data.

Polynomial regression is the simple approach to build non-linear models. It tries to add quadratic terms(square,cube) to a regression.

Why to use Polynomial Regression then ?

When using Linear regression over non-linear data, the outcome is in form of straight line ie. the straight line doesnt capture patterns in the data.
This scenario is termed as under-fitting (Highly Biased Model as model results are prone to give more training error).
*Errors  in regression are ideally evaluated using RMSE,R2

To give a brief example about it, I have included video which explains polynomial regression using Boston Housing Dataset Example.
